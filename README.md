# TMDB-Movie-Dataset-Analysis
In this project, analysis of TMDB Movie Dataset has been done using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib


For this Data Analysis Project,I am using TMDB Movie Dataset. This dataset contains records of more than 10,000 movies with features and some information about the movies such as title,popularity,budget,revenue,cast,director,tagline,runtime,genres,release date and so on.

In the Data analysis process,I have analysed some of the characteristics from the data given by first wrangling and cleaning the dataset to get a clean dataset.

Some of the questions that I have analysed from the dataset are: 
1)Which movie made the highest profit? 
2)What runtime of movies is mostly made? 
3)Did the number of movies made increase from 1965 to 2015? 
4)Do high budget movies earn more profit or do low budget movies earn more profit? 
5)Comparision of Budget and Profit w.r.t years
